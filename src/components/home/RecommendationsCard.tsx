Our timezones were nearly 12 hours apart, but he was great about being flexible with meeting times in order to accommodate the rest of the team. It wasn't uncommon that we'd send something his way at the end of our working day and wake up to a full set of PRs and features built. He's a great collaborator and keeps the user's perspective in mind when offering feedback and suggestions on product development. I'd recommend Haasin without hesitation â€” he'd be a valuable asset to any organization."

He learns incredibly quickly, moves fast, communicates well, and has a bias towards action. I've also been impressed with his ability to be product-minded and think about the user's needs. He often brings ideas to the table of how we could make the product better, which shows how much he cares about quality and our business goals. Lastly, his calm demeanor makes him a pleasure to work with and enables him to build relationships quickly. Can't recommend him highly enough."
